    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 ¼ tsp) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm water (110°F/45°C)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil or melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and sprinkle the yeast on top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil, then mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place in a greased loaf pan and let it rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
        <li>Let cool before slicing and serving.</li>
